# What is linked list?  
• Linked list is a fundamental structure in C  
• Linked list is a dynamic data structure whose length can be increase or decrease at run time  

# About my linked list?  
• This is doublely linked list (also included circlely linked list).  
• I use this for storing student information that included: name, age.  
• Data can be store by reading and writing to txt file (originally by C).  
  
# Advantage of linked list  
• Dynamic data structure  
    ‣ Linked list is a dynamic data structure so it can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memeory. So there is no need to give initial size of linked list.  
  
• No memory wastage.  
• Insertion and deletion.  
  
# Disadvantage of linked list  
• More memory required for comparing to arrray (because structure node need memory for storing structure pointer).  
• Traversal  
    ‣ Data can't be access easily as array without finding through node pointer.  
  
• Reserve traversing  
    ‣ In one-way linked list, reserve traversing is really difficult.  
    ‣ In my case, doublely linkedlist in use. It's useful but waste memory more than singlely linked list.
