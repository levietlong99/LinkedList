# LinkedList
A type of data structure in C - by using structure and struct pointer  
  
# What is linked list?  
• Linked list is a fundamental structure in C  
• Linked list is a dynamic data structure whose length can be increase or decrease at run time  
  
# Advantage of linked list  
• Dynamic data structure   
  > Linked list is a dynamic data structure so it can grow and shrink at runtime by allocating and deallocating memeory. So there is no need to give initial size of linked list.  
  
• No memory wastage.  
• Insertion and deletion.  
  
# Disadvantage of linked list  
• More memory required for comparing to arrray (because structure node need memory for storing structure pointer).  
• Traversal  
  > Data can't be access easily as array without finding through node pointer.  
  
• Reserve traversing  
  > In one-way linked list, reserve traversing is really difficult.  
  > In my case, double linkedlist in use. It's useful but waste memory more than simple linked list.
